# Morsible
A messaging application that allows two mobile devices to communicate using Morse Code in real-time using Firebase as the back-end.
Users are added to a session upon login and are displayed in a single list-view. Tapping the button displays a colored-border around the appropriate user list-item in addition to playing a tone throughout the duration of the tap.
Future implementation:
Live transcription of morse code displayed in the user's list-item
Customizable tones and colors
